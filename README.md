# Data Science Pipeline with Jupyter, Pandas, and FastAPI

This project demonstrates a data science pipeline using Jupyter notebooks, the Pandas data analysis library, and the FastAPI web framework. The dataset used in this project is a collection of top box-office movies with local and global net revenue data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the provided dataset, extract meaningful insights, and expose the results through a FastAPI web application.

## Steps in the Data Science Pipeline

1. Data Collection: The dataset provided contains information about top box-office movies, including local and global net revenue data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Using Pandas in a Jupyter notebook, the data is cleaned and preprocessed. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and normalizing data.

3. Data Analysis: The cleaned data is then analyzed using various statistical methods to extract meaningful insights. This could include finding the average revenue, identifying the highest and lowest grossing movies, etc.

4. Data Visualization: The results of the analysis are visualized using appropriate graphs and charts. This helps in better understanding the trends and patterns in the data.

5. Building the API: A FastAPI application is developed to expose the results of the analysis. This allows users to interact with the data and insights in a user-friendly manner.

## Running the Project

Instructions on how to set up and run the project are provided in the README file of the repository. This includes installing necessary dependencies, running the Jupyter notebook, and starting the FastAPI application.
